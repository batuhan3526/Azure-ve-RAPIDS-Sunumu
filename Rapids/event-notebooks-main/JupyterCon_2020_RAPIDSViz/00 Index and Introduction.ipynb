    "## Introduction to RAPIDS Visualization\n",
    "The RAPIDS viz group's overall goal is to build open source libraries and collaborate with other open source projects. We hope to foster a greater adoption of GPUs in the python visualization ecosystem and beyond. Its not just for the sake of making things faster - we feel that when data scientist and analysts are able to interact with larger datasets in real time and with high fidelity, they will be able to ask better questions, more often, and get more accurate answers to today's complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAPIDS Supported Viz Frameworks\n",
    "The below frameworks currently support RAPIDS - primarily through using cuDF as a data source: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/)**: wrapper API for easily visualizing data. \n",
    "- **[cuxfilter](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuxfilter)**: RAPIDS library for easily cross-filtering data. \n",
    "- **[Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/gpu-dask-acceleration/)**: framework for production ready visualization applications.\n",
    "- **[Datashader](https://datashader.org/)**: library for high fidelity server side data rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAPIDS visualization team is continually working to integrate with other open source projects - if you wish to help or have questions, reach out on our [Community Slack Channel (GOAI)](https://join.slack.com/t/rapids-goai/shared_invite/zt-h54mq1uv-KHeHDVCYs8xvZO5AB~ctTQ). \n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU Compute and/or GPU Render\n",
    "Generally RAPIDS works to accelerate visualization through faster compute - that is computing aggregations, filters, algorithms etc. quickly enough to be directly interacted with through a visualization. GPUs can also speed up visualization through faster data rendering (of which people more often associate GPUs). The architecture required to do one or both of these through web browsers can be complex, but is useful to understand when building advanced visualizations. Feel free to ask for details and future plans in our [Community Slack Channel (GOAI)](https://join.slack.com/t/rapids-goai/shared_invite/zt-h54mq1uv-KHeHDVCYs8xvZO5AB~ctTQ).\n"
